# bebop_waypoint_navigation

* In this program, the bebop drone navigates to pre-specified (x,y) coordinates
* In order to run the Autonomous Program, two networks are required in order to connect to the motion capture system and drone, plug in USB WIFI Adapter ( we used LYNEC 150 Mbps)

-> Connect to the Optitrack network  

-> Connect to the drone wifi network
